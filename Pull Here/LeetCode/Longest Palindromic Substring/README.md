## Problem
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

A string is called a palindrome string if the reverse of that string is the same as the original string.

## Example 1:
```

Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
## Example 2:

## Constraints
*   1 <= s.length <= 1000
*   s consist of only digits and English letters.
